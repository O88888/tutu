Hello world! This is my first post!

I've actually created the same website (with the same name) around four hours ago (and finished around one hour ago), but I couldn't figure what went wrong with the dark-and-light mode switcher. I decided to delete all three hours of work and start a new one.

This is the fourth time of me using GitHub to create a personal blog...

My blogging (or more like personal website because I didn't write that many blogs lol) went like this: **Wix** (two websites; I messed up one and made a second) - **Wordpress** (three websites; one personal; one personal but I would write it on my resume, like a portfolio; one public for the TEDxYouth event I organized) - **GitHub Pages** (maybe around four because the last three failed; the first one I used the Jekyll theme Hitchens and the rest I used the Jekyll theme Chirpy)

Hopefully this will start my new journey of creating/writing fun and interactive websites myself!

接下来的工作就是把之前在Wordpress里面写的部落格都搬过这边来，所以在这个日期之前的posts全部都是之前Wordpress上的一些碎碎念😶，然后还会再把我最近写的一些东西（没有很多）打上来（因为基本都是语文课小作文手写😳，对不起博主需要这样凑篇数😳）。希望能在6月12号日本一人游之前弄完，因为6月12号之后我就会开始正式更新我的posts了（先是以游记为主🤤）！

Anyways, hope I'll have fun! And hopefully when I'm older and when I look back on these posts, they'll remind me of my life back in high school and college.
