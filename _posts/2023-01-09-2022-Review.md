“Change has become a constant, the way we embrace defines our future.” 

— Queen Elizabeth II

2022 is yet another exciting and hard year for all of us around the world. We have again captured the image of a black hole, Sagittarius A*, which belongs to the center of our galaxy, with the Event Horizon Telescope. James Webb Space Telescope left humans at awe of the beauty of the cosmos. With the launch of Artemis I, humans begin a new journey to the moon and beyond. Artificial intelligence becomes more implemented in our daily lives through instant art and essay generators. We have also leaped an important step into producing clean energy through nuclear fusion. Among the countless achievements, however, we also grieve from the losses of many. Environmental pollution still rages with uncontrollable climate change and biodiversity loss. In June, Roe v Wade was overturned, banning abortion across the United States. In December, the Taliban had banned women from going to universities in Afghanistan. 

Rummaging through Google’s “Year in Search” and Vox’s annual wrap videos I realized that as I age, especially as a teenager, I start to get more involved events happening around me and with the world. I would get into heated debates into social issues, listen to podcasts like “Breaking Down Patriarchy” and “The Gray Area”, and read thoughtful and in-depth books and articles regarding these issues. This year was also unique to me. 

After two years of staying at home, we were finally able to travel, with great caution. Planning meticulously of a road trip to north western China, we were, however, flustered by the Covid cases that were chasing behind us everywhere we went. Having no choice but to cut our trip a few days short, we managed, luckily, to finish about 80% of our original plans. When my dad encouraged me to ride camels in Mingsha Mountain in DunHuang, saying that it would be a unique experience, I was excited. As we enter the field where the camels were kept, however, I started to become reluctant, not because of the odorous smell and the seemingly unordered crowds of camels that fill up the field, but because of how the camels acted as we mounted. The camels at the site, huge, khaki colored creatures with their floppy and collapsed humps who once sit on the throne of the desert were now subjected to human calls. When mandated to allow us to mount on their backs, the camels kneel first with their front legs, hard on the ground, sand dispersing into the air and into our eyes. With their whole body shaking and the saddles almost fallen from the body, they kneel once again with their back legs. Kneeling on the ground, they await for us. Their brand formed from burning their skin with hot iron were presented stung my eyes. Suddenly, I feel ashamed to ride on a camel. I wondered how can one kneel before me with so much pain and still allow me to ride on their backs. There must be inner cries of vulnerability and fragility as they were burnt the marks of ownership, the labels of subjection, and the loss of one’s own body. I mounted the camel, let my hands rest on the steel horn on the damaged saddle and my feet on the stirrups. As the camels walk in a shaky but even pace, leashed by a rope that connects five camels in a group, I sense the desperation in their steps. Up the sand hill, across the track, down the hill, back to the field, another journey. Yes, the view was significant: camels in groups slowly winding up the sand hill. Somehow you feel a portion that sense of roaming across the desert with groups of people hundreds of years ago—like an exploration. But the rest was different. Staff holding the rope would stop and ask if you want to take pictures with the camels at a cost of 5 RM B per photo. Yet other staffs standing beside the track would take photos of you riding the camel for 20 RMB. On the other side of the hill, you would see sand motors racing rapidly up and down the slope and helicopters spying the entire site. Modern and fun, you might say. All I could see is avarice. (I wrote this paragraph on January 1st, 2023)

There is another moment in my life I want to share. It happened quite a few years ago, possibly in middle school. As born Chinese southerners, our family loves the dish yellow catfish with braised eggs. We would always buy live yellow catfish and slaughter them in the sink. 

At the time I am writing this, 2022 is only one hour left in China time (in Japan time it would already be 2023). Amazingly and somehow unexpectedly, I heard the sounds of fireworks. Reminded by the pictures I saw a few months ago that was taken back in 2013, in which blurred fireworks can be seen because the camera was not focused, I was taken back in time to the memories of my past 17 years on Earth and the wonderful and yet harsh journeys I had experienced. 

We are made to progress. As time goes on and continues into the unknown, we can only keep up and make the best of it during our short lives.
