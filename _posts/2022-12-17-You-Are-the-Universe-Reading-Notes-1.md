## Preface

The creation of sight is done by you. Without you, the entire world—and the vast universe extending in all directions—can’t exist. 

Everything that makes a star real requires a human observer with a human nervous system. 

You are the creator of reality, and yet you have no idea how you do it—the process is effortless. 

This is a participatory universe that depends for its very existence on human beings. 

Paradigms keep shifting, driven by human curiosity and, for the past four hundred years, viewed through the lens held up by science. 

At the moment, the paradigm that dominates science posits an uncertain, random universe devoid of purpose and meaning. 

Paradigms are self-fulfilling, so the only way to cause radical change is to jump out of them. 

All of us live in a participatory universe. Once you decide that you want to participate fully, with mind, body, and should, the paradigm shift becomes personal. The reality you inhabit will be yours to either embrace or change.
